                        Your bones don't break, mine do. That's clear. Your
                        cells react to bacteria and viruses differently than
                        mine. You don't get sick, I do. That's also clear. But
                        for some reason, you and I react the exact same way to
                        water. We swallow it too fast, we choke. We get some in
                        our lungs, we drown. However unreal it may seem, we are
                        connected, you and I. We're on the same curve, just on
                        opposite ends.

                You think water moves fast? You should see ice. It moves like it
                has a mind. Like it knows it killed the world once and got a
                taste for murder. After the avalanche, it took us a week to
                climb out. Now, I don't know exactly when we turned on each
                other, but I know that seven of us survived the slide... and
                only five made it out. Now we took an oath, that I'm breaking
                now. We said we'd say it was the snow that killed the other two,
                but it wasn't. Nature is lethal but it doesn't hold a candle to
                man.
