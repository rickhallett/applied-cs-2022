# Applied CS 2022

A repository for learning and showcasing my self selected curriculum for computer science for the year of 2022.

For self taught engineers, the biggest trouble is not knowing what to focus on, but know what to _ignore_.

A classically educated compSci graduate is exposed to a litany of subjects, not all of which are relevant to my frontend role at Brandwatch. That said, a few fundamentals stick out:

1. Alorithms and Data Structures
2. Design Patterns and SOLID principles
3. Refactoring, especially alongside TDD methods
4. Common patterns and component heirarchies within enterprise level React/Redux applications

It's only in the thoroughness these things are learnt to any useful depths, and drills can be useful for providing the repetition required to develop the intuitive expertise that a senior developer uses as part of their daily practice.

##

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
